# Unveiling the potential of GNN for network modeling and optimization in SDN

Datasets can be downloaded from these links:

* NSFNet topology: http://knowledgedefinednetworking.org/data/nsfnet.zip  
  (This dataset was randomly partitioned to obtain the training and evaluation datasets)
* GEANT2 topology: http://knowledgedefinednetworking.org/data/geant2.zip
* GBN topology: http://knowledgedefinednetworking.org/data/GBN.zip  
  (The last two datasets were used only for evaluation)
  
 Also, we provide a detailed description of the datasets [here](http://knowledgedefinednetworking.org/data/README_gnn.pdf).
 
Please, if you have any doubt on how to process the datasets do not hesitate to contact us by sending an email to \
kdn-users@knowledgedefinednetworking.org. Also, you can subscribe to this mailing list to follow up discussions about papers related to KDN (Link: https://mail.knowledgedefinednetworking.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/kdn-users).
